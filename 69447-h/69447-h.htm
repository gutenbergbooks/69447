<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>


<p>The object of the following pages is to bring under one head the
information that is scattered through Despatches, Army Lists, Gazettes,
Books, Magazines, &amp;c. concerning the History of the different Regiments
of the British Army; and to enable anyone at a glance to ascertain
whether a certain Regiment served during a certain campaign, or was at
a certain action, or what its Title or Uniform was at a certain date.</p>

<p>The histories of many Regiments have been published separately, some
by authority, and a few through, and by, the <i>esprit de corps</i> of
some officer, but this is intended to show every existing Regiment’s
services, &amp;c. in a small space, in a condensed form, and in one volume.</p>

<p>Since the year 1870, much has been seen, and more heard, about
organization and localization,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[iv]</span> but we have also seen the Regiments
(which were the admiration of soldiers of every country in Europe),
“meddled and muddled” with till they are only a wretched likeness of
what they were.</p>

<p>We have seen <i>esprit de corps</i> sapped to its foundations, and
attempted to be destroyed by the abolition of every Regimental
tradition, badge, and even button, that our civilian Army reformers
could do away with.</p>

<p>Where are the old Regimental officers who were proud to serve the Crown
for <i>nothing</i>?</p>

<p>Where are the magnificent old non-commissioned officers and men that
would follow their officers wherever they led?</p>

<p>What is the answer?</p>

<p>The officers, commissioned and non-commissioned, have all but
disappeared, and the ranks are filled by over-educated boys, who
consequently think they are as competent to lead their comrades as
their officers.</p>

<p>Moreover, we now see all ranks looking forward to the time when they
shall be turned out of the Regiment, instead of, as formerly, looking
on it as their home for the best part of their lives.</p>

<p>Then, as another blow to the old constitution of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">[v]</span> Regiments, and a
reduction of their fighting power, we have the new “Brigade Depôts,”
and “Linked Battalions.”</p>

<p>Do not the pages of the Army List, with this last heading, betray the
fact that the Regiments must have been “linked” together by some one
who was incompetent to do so?</p>

<p>Take the 27th Inniskilling, a Regiment essentially Irish in its
character and composition, “linked” to the 108th Madras Infantry. What
connection the person entrusted with a matter of such vital importance
could see in these two Regiments is quite beyond the imagination of a
soldier, and gives rise to the id=ea that he must have drawn them out of
a hat. The 27th has a glorious history of two centuries; the 108th was
only raised by the East India Company in 1854, and has no more to do
with Ireland than the Russian Guards.</p>

<p>Look at the 31st Huntingdonshire and the 70th Surrey “linked” together
at Kingston. Is every Huntingdonshire man who wishes to join his county
Regiment to walk all the way to Kingston to enlist? and when he does
so, be uncertain whether he is to wear the Huntingdon buff or the
Surrey black?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span></p>

<p>Had only the depôt of the 35th Royal Sussex been localized at
Chichester to obtain recruits for that regiment, it would have been
perfect; as it is, the “Brigade Depôt” at that city is partly formed of
two nominal companies of the 107th Bengal Infantry, which Regiment of
course never had the slightest connection with the county of Sussex.</p>

<p>The two depôts, or four nominal companies, form the “43rd Brigade
Depôt.” It surely might have been numbered the “35th Brigade Depôt,”
and so have kept up a semblance of the old county number.</p>

<p>It follows, therefore, that a man of Sussex wishing to enlist in his
county Regiment, first has to go into the “43rd Brigade Depôt,” and
then may find himself in the 107th Bengal Infantry, which Regiment he
never intended to serve in at all!</p>

<p>But the above examples of ill-matched couples will suffice.</p>

<p>Is it wonderful that soldiers with the least gleam of <i>esprit de
corps</i> desert?</p>

<p>The fact is, that the glorious old Regiments of the British Army are
in process of being improved off the face of the martial world, and if
the system<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span> of “Brigade Depôts” is persevered in, the Regiment must
eventually disappear.</p>

<p>Let anyone read the “General Order” of the 17th March 1873. It says&mdash;</p>

<p>“The single Battalion Regiments, which are linked together to form the
Line portion of a sub-district Brigade, will, so far as regards the
Sub-Lieutenants thereto appointed, and the soldiers therein enlisted,
after the date of this order, <i>constitute one corps</i> for all
military purposes.</p>

<p>“All first appointments to the Line, and all enlistments for Line
service, will be for the particular Brigade, <i>instead of as
heretofore, for particular Regiments</i>.”</p>

<p>“The officers and soldiers who may be so appointed to any Brigade,
will, for relief, for all duties at home and abroad, and for every
military purpose whatsoever, <i>and in whatever ranks they may
thereafter respectively hold, be interchangeable between the Line
Battalions of their Brigade, and will be liable to serve in either
of those Battalions indifferently, without regard to the particular
Battalion to which they may have been first appointed to serve</i>.”</p>

<p>There rang the death-knell of the old Regiments of the British Army!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span></p>

<p>Can anything be more conclusive, or more depressing to a soldier?</p>

<p>Is it calculated to foster that prid=e in, and love for, his own
particular Regiment that every true soldier who has worn its uniform
has for it?</p>

<p>Look again at the “Army Circular” of the 8th April 1876, as to the
clothing of the men of the “Brigade Depôts;” it is evid=ent that a man
belongs neither to one “linked” Battalion or to the other; he belongs
to the “Brigade Depôt” only, and has nothing to do with the traditions
or honour of the Regiment in which he may be serving.</p>

<p>Would-be Army reformers, of whom we have now far too many, say, “Oh,
very few Regiments now have the Title of the county in which they were
raised, so all this is of no importance;” but they are not soldiers,
so their opinion is valueless. Moreover, the assertion is only partly
true, for it is nearly a century since most of the Regiments received
the County Titles which they now bear.</p>

<p>Would-be Army reformers are also responsible for the Appendix to “Army
Circular” of the 1st of December 1877, giving the War Establishment
of a Battalion of Infantry, in which it is actually proposed to
send a Regiment of boys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span> eleven hundred strong into the field with
twenty-three Company officers, whilst four officers of the Regiment are
part of, and nearly useless at, the “Brigade Depôt.”</p>

<p>We hear and we read everywhere that the Army is over-officered, but
what is the opinion of an old soldier, as given in his lecture at the
Royal United Service Institution on the 30th November 1877? He says:</p>

<p>“How can you expect fire-discipline, from year-old peasant-soldiers,
whose non-commissioned officers have little, if any, greater training
than themselves, and with a field average of three and a half officers
per company of two hundred men? For better or for worse, we have now an
army of boys. Take the word of a man who has seen much fighting, both
by trained and untrained soldiers. It behoves us, if we would escape
disaster in the hour of trial, to take such means as will induce our
non-commissioned officers to remain under the colours, and not go forth
into civil, or quasi-civil life. And yet more incumbent is it on us to
listen to no arguments of theory that would reduce the number of our
commissioned officers. Our Army is so small that, more than any other,
for the sake of judicious daring,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span> and of judicious economy of life, it
must be well, brilliantly, and carefully led. And this cannot be when
sparse officers are whelmed in a confused mass of men.”</p>

<p>What do the advocates of short service and “Brigade Depôts” say to this?</p>

<p>From the foregoing remarks it will readily be perceived that the
desire of the Compiler of this book is not to destroy, but to revive,
<i>everything</i> connected with every Regiment in the service, and,
although omissions may be noted, it is hoped it contains no errors.</p>

<p>There are many conflicting statements as to when Regiments were first
numbered. Their <i>rank</i> was first regulated by a board of General
Officers assembled by King William the Third in the Netherlands, on the
10th June 1694.</p>

<p>Queen Anne assembled another board in 1713, to decid=e on the rank
of Regiments raised subsequently to 1694, and King George the First
assembled a third in 1715 for the same purpose.</p>

<p>Cannon, in his “History of the Marine Corps,” tells us, “These boards
recommended that English Regiments raised in England should take rank
from the date of their formation, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span> English, Scots, and Irish
Regiments raised for the service of a foreign power, should take rank
from the date of their being placed on the English Establishment.”</p>

<p>“The numerical Titles of Regiments, as fixed on the principles laid=
down in the Reports of the boards of General Officers above alluded
to, were confirmed by the Warrant issued by authority of King George
the Second, dated the 17th July 1761; and also by the Warrant of King
George the Third, dated 19th December 1768; previously to which,
Regiments were generally designated by the names of their Colonels.”</p>

<p>The year 1751 has, therefore, been taken as the date on which the
Regiments of the Army were first recognized officially by a number.</p>

<p>The date of the raising of the different Regiments is given as that
of the commission of its first Colonel, taken from the official
“Succession of Colonels.”</p>

<p>The greatest difficulty has been the compiling of the lists of
Campaigns, &amp;c. in which the various Regiments have borne a part.</p>

<p>All those that appear on the Colours have been given, although many are
of inferior importance to many that do not; moreover many Regiments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[xii]</span>
have received distinctions for actions in which others shared who do
not possess any record of the fact upon their Colours.</p>

<p>The dates given are those in Haydn’s “Dictionary of Dates,” which is
assumed to be correct, and, in the case of a capture of a place, the
<i>last</i> day of the siege or capture is given.</p>

<p>The thanks of the Compiler are due to those Adjutants and other
officers of Regiments who have given him information, and also to T. D.
Sullivan, Esq., late 56th Foot, Librarian of the Royal United Service
Institution, for his assistance and help on many occasions.</p>

<p>It is said= the Regiments of Life Guards were at one time known as “the
Cheeses,” from the old gentlemen of the Life Guards declining to serve
in them as remodelled in 1788, saying they were no longer composed of
gentlemen, but of cheesemongers.</p>

<p>The first Second Troop of Life Guards consisted originally of a number
of loyal gentlemen who had fought for King Charles I. After his murder
they fled to the continent, and entered the Spanish service with the
title of “His Royal Highness The Duke of York’s Troop of Guards.” After
the peace of 1659 they retired to the Netherlands till 1660, when King
Charles II. made them the Second Troop of Life Guards. It became the
Third Troop in 1670, and was disbanded in 1746.</p>

<p>The Regiment has the same origin as the First Life Guards.</p>

<p>It wore cuirasses from its formation to 1698, and resumed them in 1821.</p>

<p>It bears the Royal Arms as its crest.</p>

<p>It obtained its sea-green facings in honour of Queen Catherine, whose
favourite colour it was. It is not known when the facings were changed,
but it was between 1690 and 1742; its standard was changed from crimson
to blue in 1758.</p>

<p>It bears the Royal Arms as its crest.</p>

<p>It obtained the name of “Oxford Blues” about 1690 to distinguish it
from a Dutch Regiment of Horse Guards dressed in Blue commanded by the
Earl of Portland, this Regiment being commanded by the Earl of Oxford.
It was also known as the “Blue Guards” during the campaign in Flanders
1742–45, and is now commonly called “The Blues.”</p>

<p>It was presented by King William IV. with a Standard emblazoned with
“Dettingen, Minden, Warbourg, Cateau.”</p>

<p>It received its title and facings on its formation in honour of Queen
Catherine, (wife of King Charles II.), whose favourite colour was
sea-green.</p>

<p>It received its title in 1692 from being armed with long pistols called
“Carabines,” and for its gallantry in Ireland in 1690–91.</p>

<p>It was known at one time as “the first Regiment of Carabiniers,” and
has been nicknamed “Tichborne’s Own” since the famous trial of Arthur
Orton, Sir Roger Tichborne having served in the Regiment.</p>

<p>It captured the colour of “the Royal Regiment of Bombardiers” at the
battle of Ramilica, and its gallantry at the battle of Neer Landen
pleased the King so greatly that he presented it with his charger.</p>

<p>The Regiment was raised in Ireland from among the loyal Protestants who
had fought at the battle of the Boyne, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It received its title, crest, and motto in 1777 as a mark of Royal
approbation of its conduct.</p>

<p>It bears the “Harp and Crown” with the motto “Pristinæ virtutis
memores.”</p>

<p>It and the 76th Foot captured forty-four stand of Colours and
seventy-two guns at the battle of Leswarree.</p>

<p>It was permitted to wear the sword belt over the right shoulder for its
gallantry at the battle of Saragossa, where it took the belts of the
Spanish Cavalry. This was confirmed by the King’s Regulations of 1768,
which caused it to be commonly known as “the Cross Belts.”</p>

<p>It was known as “St. George’s” from its Colonel’s name 1740–1755.</p>

and the vicinity of London in 1759; its Colonel chose its crest of a

<p>The Regiment was in the service of Sweden from 1625 to 1633, and in
that of France from 1633 to 1678, except in 1661, 1667, and 1668.</p>

<p>Tradition asserts that it was originally the Body-Guard of the Scottish
Kings.</p>

<p>It bore, in 1633, St. Andrew’s Cross, with Thistle and Crown; and, in
1751, the distinction of the Colours of 2nd Battalion was a flaming ray
of gold from the upper corner of each Colour to the centre.</p>

<p>It bears the Royal Cypher within the Collar of St. Andrew, and the
Crown over it; also the Thistle and Crown, with the motto of the Order,
“Nemo me impune lacessit.”</p>

<p>It captured a Colour from the Moors at the defence of Tanjier, in 1680,
for which it received its title in 1684; it also captured the Duke of
Monmouth’s Standard at the Battle of Sedgmoor, 1685.</p>

<p>It is nicknamed “Pontius Pilate’s Body Guard,” from its antiquity.</p>

<p>The Regiment was raised in England to garrison Tanjier, part of the
dowry of Catherine of Braganza, wife of King Charles II.; but it
was partly formed at Tanjier from the Duke of Gloucester’s, Earl of
Bristol’s, Lord Newborough’s, and Colonel Green’s Regiments in the
Spanish service.</p>

<p>It received on its formation the Badge of the “Paschal Lamb,” the
crest of the House of Braganza, and Sea-green facings, that being the
favourite colour of Queen Catherine.</p>

<p>It bears the Royal Cypher within the Garter, and Crown over it; and the
“Paschal Lamb” with the mottoes “<i>Pristinæ virtutis memor</i>” and
“<i>Vel exuviæ triumphant</i>”; also “the Sphinx” for Egypt, 1801.</p>

<p>It received its title and first motto in 1703 for its gallant conduct
at Tongres, 1703.</p>

<p>It is said= to have been called “the Governor’s Regiment” at its
formation.</p>

<p>It was nicknamed “Kirke’s Lambs,” from its Badge and Colonel from 1682
to 1691; also “the Sleepy Queen’s,” from its carelessness at Almeid=a in
allowing General Brennier to escape.</p>

<p>The Regiment had been in the service of Holland from the time of
Queen Elizabeth, and so retained its title on being taken on the
establishment of the British Army.</p>

<p>It bore in 1686 the Red Cross of St. George bordered with white on a
green ground.</p>

<p>It received its badge of “the Dragon” for its gallant conduct on all
occasions, and as indicating the origin of the Regiment in the reign of
Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>It also bears the Rose and Crown.</p>

<p>It captured eleven guns and a Standard at the Battle of Punniar.</p>

<p>It was nicknamed “the Buff Howards,” from its facings and Colonel from
1737 to 1749; also “the Nut-crackers”; and “the Resurrectionists,”
from its reappearing at the Battle of Albuera after being dispersed
by the Polish Lancers; also “the Old Buffs” from its facings, and to
distinguish it from the 31st, “the Young Buffs;” but the most ancient
“Old Buffs” was the “Duke of York and Albany’s Maritime Regiment,”
raised in 1664, that was incorporated into the 2nd or Coldstream Guards
in 1689.</p>

<p>The Regiment is one of those that came from Holland with King William
III., it had previously been known as “the Irish Regiment.”</p>

<p>It bears “St. George and the Dragon” (the ancient badge of the
Regiment), “the Rose and Crown,” “the King’s Crest,” and the motto “Quo
fata vocant.”</p>

<p>It is not known when the facings were changed to Green. The peculiar
shade now worn is said= to have been first adopted in consequence of the
colour fading.</p>

<p>It was permitted to wear Fuzileer caps in commemoration of its
defeating a French Division of Grenadiers at the battle of
Wilhelmstahl, 1762; and also a white plume in the cap for its gallantry
at St. Lucia in 1778, with the Grenadier and Light Battalions which
formed “the Reserve.” These troops plucked the white feathers from the
hats of the dead French, and decorated their own with them. The 5th is
the only Regiment that has retained the distinction by now wearing a
red and white pompon.</p>

<p>It received its title in 1782 in compliment to its Colonel, Earl Percy.</p>

<p>It was nicknamed in 1764 “the Shiners” from its clean and smart
appearance; and in the Peninsula “the Old Bold Fifth,” “the Fighting
Fifth,” and “Lord Wellington’s Body-Guard,” from being at Head-quarters
in 1811.</p>

distinction.</p>

<p>It bears “The Royal Cypher within the Garter”; and the badge and motto
of the Order of The Thistle, viz., “St. Andrew” and “Nemo me impune
lacessit”; also “The Sphinx,” for Egypt, 1801.</p>

<p>The Regiment was raised in the north of England.</p>

<p>It was allowed to wear a red plume in the hat, for the conduct of its
Light Company in 1777, which with five others of different Regiments
composed “The Light Battalion” which made itself so obnoxious to the
Americans, that they said= they would give it no quarter; to prevent
mistakes, the Light Battalion dyed their feathers red. The Regiment is
the only one that has retained this distinction.</p>

<p>It was nicknamed “Murray’s Bucks” from its Colonel’s name 1743 to 1764;
also “The Surprisers” from its surprise of General Wayne’s American
Brigade in September 1777; also “The Lacedemonians” from its Colonel
making it a long speech under a heavy fire about the Lacedemonians and
their discipline; also it is said= to have been commonly known at one
time as “The Edinburgh Regiment.”</p>

<p>It is said= its facings were changed in 1764, in consequence of the
crimson wearing so badly; the Colonel then wished to have Blue, but
this not being allowed, he took purple, the favourite colour of Madame
de Pompadour, mistress of King Louis XV. of France; from which it was
nicknamed “The Pompadours”; and also “The Saucy Pompeys.”</p>

92nd Regiments of Foot, and was then commonly known as “Manningham’s
Sharpshooters” from its Colonel’s name, and its being armed with rifles.</p>

<p>It bore a “Bugle Horn” before the badge of “The Maltese Cross” was
adopted, which probably took place when the names of victories were
first granted. It was at first surmounted with a figure of “Fame.” The
Cross was surmounted by a Crown about 1830.</p>

<p>It ranks next to the 93rd Sutherland Highlanders.</p>

<p>It is nicknamed “The Sweeps” from its dark coloured uniform.</p>

<p>It bears “The Globe” with motto “Per Mare, per Terram”; also “The
Crown,” “The Anchor and Laurel” for its services at Belle Isle in 1761,
and “The Royal Cypher.”</p>

<p>It received its Title in 1802, in commemoration of its services during
the late war.</p>

<p>It was nicknamed by the French at Belle Isle “The little Grenadiers”
from its wearing grenadier caps; and is now known as “The Jollies.”</p>

<p>It ranks next to the 49th Princess Charlotte of Wales’s, having been
raised after that Regiment, and before the 50th Queen’s Own.</p>

<p>It is composed of “Royal Marine Artillery” raised in 1804, and “Royal
Marine Light Infantry.” It received this Title in 1855.</p>

<p>The first Regiment especially raised for sea service was “His Royal
Highness The Duke of York and Albany’s Maritime Regiment,” raised in
1664. Its uniform was Yellow with Scarlet facings. It was incorporated
into the present Coldstream Guards in 1689.</p>

<p>Six Marine Regiments were raised in 1702, three were disbanded in
1713, and the others are the present 30th Cambrid=geshire, the 31st
Huntingdonshire, and the 32nd Cornwall Light Infantry.</p>

<p>The present 6th Royal First Warwickshire, 19th Princess of Wales’s Own,
20th East Devonshire, 34th Cumberland, 35th Royal Sussex, and 36th
Herefordshire, were placed on the Marine Establishment for sea service
in 1702, and served as Marines for some years.</p>

<p>In 1739 six Regiments of Marines were formed, and four more in 1740;
their facings were as follows:&mdash; 1st Regiment, Yellow; 2nd, Green; 3rd,
Yellow; 4th, White; 5th, Yellow; 6th, Green; 7th, White; 8th, Yellow;
9th, Buff; 10th, Yellow. They were all disbanded in 1748.</p>

<p class="center sm"><i>In Frame, 21s.</i></p>


<p>A map of this kind brings before us such a picture of the surface of
a given country as no ordinary map could ever do. To the mind’s eye
of the average Englishman, India consists of ‘the plains’ and ‘the
hills,’ chiefly of the former, the hills being limited to the Himalayas
and the Nilgiris. The new map will at least enable him to correct his
notions of Indian geography. It combines the usual features of a good
plain map of the country on a scale of 150 miles to the inch, with
a faithful representation of all the uneven surfaces, modelled on a
scale thirty-two times the horizontal one; thus bringing out into clear
relief the comparative heights and outlines of all the hill-ranges,
and showing broad tracts of uneven ground, of intermingled hill and
valley, which a common map of the same size would hardly indicate,
except to a very practised eye. The plains of Upper India are reduced
to their true proportions; the Central Provinces, Malwa, and Western
Bengal reveal their actual ruggedness at a glance; and Southern India,
from the Vindhyas to Cape Comorin, proclaims its real height above
the sea-level. To the historical as well as the geographical student
such a map is an obvious and important aid= in tracing the course of
past campaigns, in realising the conditions under which successive
races carried their arms or settlements through the Peninsula, and
in comprehending the difference of race, climate, and physical
surroundings which make up our Indian Empire. Set in a neat frame of
maplewood, the map seems to attract the eye like a prettily-coloured
picture, and its price, a guinea, should place it within the reach
of all who care to combine the useful with the ornamental.“&mdash;<i>Home

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project

        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
